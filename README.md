This repo will be used to design, implement and evaluate a strategy for detecting abandoned objects in video surveillance applications

To change the classes to track you must change the following lines:

```object_tracking.py or object_tracking-COLAB.py >> lines 119 and 122```


```yolo.py or yolo_COLAB >> line 104```
